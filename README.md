# Self-Driving-Car-Projects
An overview of all the self-driving car projects I'm working on


## Semester 1

### Project 1: Finding Lane Lines
This project identify lane lines on the road, first in an image, and later in a video stream (really just a series of images). ()


### Project 2: Traffic Sign Classifier Project
This project uses deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. Specifically, the mode is trained to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). Then the model is tested on new images of traffic signs found on the web.

### Project 3: Behavioral Cloning
This project clones driving behavior (specifically mine) also by using deep neural networks and convolutional neural network. The model is trained using Keras and will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle running in the simulator Udacity provided.

#### Demo 1: Comma.ai
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZmIwV8ADGw)  
I suggest you watching it in 2x speed, the car moves really slow.  
To see the part where the car is actually moving, please skip to 0:28.
